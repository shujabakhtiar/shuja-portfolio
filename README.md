## Overview

This repository houses the source code for my personal portfolio website. As I transition into senior software engineering roles, this project serves as both a showcase of my technical capabilities and a playground for refining advanced web development concepts.

The ethos behind this project is to demonstrate a "Full-Stack Enterprise AI Solutions" mindset—combining robust engineering principles with high-end, polished user experiences. It reflects my commitment to widening my skill set and strengthening core computer science concepts, from system design to pixel-perfect frontend execution.

## Tech Stack (This Project)
